# Learnable first prototype requirement
Distilled build but the foundational essence remains. 
Using the development principle User-Centered Design (USD) approach


1. Study scene
   - Displays the TOC and can navigate through each completed topic
   - Uses chat
     
3. Flashcard scene
   - Categorized by each lecture
   - Each flashcard is dynamically generated when completed a topic from the lecture scene
   
5. Question scene
   - Read only and delete only
   - Essentially the same as flashcard scene but questions are triggered as a daily exercise. Only occurs once daily every first access of the app
   - Can only use question feature as a daily exercise. User cannot trigger manually


## Storage requirement:
Using IOS Coredata
