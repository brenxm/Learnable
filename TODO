- Make a detailed documentation for conventions and structured.
    - Naming convention, for objects, suffix it with Model at the End?
    
    - When do I make a view reusable? when at least exactly 2 are using them?
    
    - Declaring variables in a View, should I group the external ones (requires parameter when using) and internal ones which values are already given upon init
