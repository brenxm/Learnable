## Component Library
- ### Lecture containers
Topic materials are rendered using Markdown as the foundational format.  
To support modern rendering standards, specialized content types (e.g., **math equations**, **programming code blocks**, and **blockquotes**) will be embedded within **stylized containers**. These containers will:
1. **Visually distinguish** specialized content from standard text (e.g., via borders, background shading, or icons)
2. **Improve scannability** by creating clear separation within the content flow.
3. **Preserve content** (e.g., syntax highlighting for code, LaTex rendering for math).
